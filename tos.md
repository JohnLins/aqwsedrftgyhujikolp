## Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Legal Disclaimer

### 1. Introduction
GauchoGuys ("the App") is a platform intended for members of the Isla Vista, Goleta, UCSB, and SBCC community to anonymously share reviews and experiences. By using the App, you agree to abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.

### 2. Privacy Policy
- **Data Collection**: We may collect and log IP addresses for purposes of moderation, security, and ensuring compliance with these terms.
- **Anonymity**: User submissions are anonymous; however, abusive or illegal activities may result in investigation and reporting to appropriate authorities.
- **Third-Party Services**: The App may use third-party services for hosting and analytics. Your use of the App implies agreement with their terms as well.

### 3. Acceptable Use
You are prohibited from:
- Posting defamatory, false, or malicious content.
- Sharing private, identifying, or threatening information about any individual.
- Using the platform for harassment, hate speech, or other harmful purposes.

We reserve the right to remove content that violates these rules and to suspend or ban users at our sole discretion.

### 4. Legal Justification
The App is protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S. Code § 230). As a provider of an interactive computer service, we are not liable for content created or posted by our users.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) is a crucial piece of U.S. internet legislation passed in 1996. It provides immunity to online platforms from being held liable for user-generated content. 

### 5. Complaints and Content Removal
If you believe a post is defamatory or violates these terms, you may email a removal request to the address provided above. While we review all requests, we are not obligated to remove any content. Removal decisions are at the sole discretion of the platform.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
The owner of the App disclaims any and all responsibility for user-generated content. Use the App at your own risk.

### 7. Changes to These Terms
We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Legal Disclaimer at any time. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
